# Introduction to Integrals

Integrals are fundamental concepts in calculus that allow us to compute areas under curves, volumes of solids, and solve various applications in science and engineering. This document provides a comprehensive overview of integrals, including both definite and indefinite integrals, techniques for integration, and their applications in data science.

## 1. Definite Integrals

### Definition
A **definite integral** is an integral that evaluates the accumulation of a quantity, such as area or distance, between two specified limits \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
\]

### Applications of Definite Integrals
1. **Calculating Distances:**
   The definite integral can be used to find the distance traveled over time by integrating a velocity function.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) \, dt
   \]

2. **Determining Areas:**
   The area under the curve of a function from \(a\) to \(b\) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
   \]

3. **Finding Volumes:**
   Volume can be calculated using integrals, especially when dealing with solids of revolution.

4. **Work Done by a Force:**
   The work done by a variable force \(F(x)\) when moving an object from point \(a\) to \(b\) is given by:
   \[
   W = \int_{a}^{b} F(x) \, dx
   \]

5. **Consumer and Producer Surplus:**
   The consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the price level, while the producer surplus is the area between the supply curve and the price level.

## 2. Indefinite Integrals

### Definition
An **indefinite integral** represents a family of functions and is defined without specific limits. It is often referred to as an antiderivative:
\[
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
\]
where \(F(x)\) is the antiderivative of \(f(x)\) and \(C\) is the constant of integration.

### Role in Differential Equations
Indefinite integrals are used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by finding functions whose derivatives match the given equations.

### Example
To find the indefinite integral:
\[
\int (3x^2) \, dx = x^3 + C
\]

### Applications in Real Life
Indefinite integrals are used in physics to find position from velocity, in economics to compute total revenue from marginal revenue, and in biology to model population growth.

## 3. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Connection Between Differentiation and Integration
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration, stating that:
1. If \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) on \([a, b]\), then:
   \[
   \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
   \]

2. If \(F\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\), then:
   \[
   F'(x) = f(x)
   \]

---

## 4. Integration Techniques

### Substitution
Substitution is used to simplify integrals by changing variables. For instance, if \(u = g(x)\), then:
\[
\int f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du
\]

### Integration by Parts
The integration by parts formula is derived from the product rule:
\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

#### Step-by-Step Example
1. Choose \(u\) and \(dv\).
2. Differentiate \(u\) to find \(du\).
3. Integrate \(dv\) to find \(v\).
4. Substitute into the formula.

**Example:**
Evaluate \(\int x e^x \, dx\):
- Let \(u = x\) and \(dv = e^x \, dx\).
- Then \(du = dx\) and \(v = e^x\).
- Applying integration by parts:
  \[
  \int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C
  \]

### Partial Fraction Decomposition
Used for rational functions, it breaks down complex fractions into simpler parts to facilitate integration.

## 5. Area Under a Curve

### Basic Concept
The area under a curve between two points can be calculated using definite integrals.

### Geometric Interpretation
The area under the curve \(f(x)\) from \(a\) to \(b\) is represented graphically and calculated using:
\[
\text{Area} = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
\]

---

## 6. Volume Calculation

### Solid of Revolution
The volume of a solid formed by revolving a region around an axis can be calculated using integrals.

#### Volume Formula
For revolving around the x-axis:
\[
V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx
\]

### Example Calculation
To find the volume of a solid formed by revolving the curve \(y = x^2\) from \(x=0\) to \(x=1\):
\[
V = \pi \int_{0}^{1} (x^2)^2 \, dx = \pi \int_{0}^{1} x^4 \, dx = \pi \left[ \frac{x^5}{5} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{\pi}{5}
\]

### Applications
Volume calculations are used in engineering and physical sciences to analyze shapes and structures.

---

## 7. Disk-Washer Method

### Volume Formula
- **Disk Method:** Used when revolving around an axis without a hole:
  \[
  V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx
  \]

- **Washer Method:** Used when there is a hole in the solid:
  \[
  V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} \left([R(x)]^2 - [r(x)]^2\right) \, dx
  \]

---

## 8. Numerical Integration

### Introduction
Numerical integration techniques estimate the value of definite integrals when analytical solutions are difficult.

### Trapezoidal Rule
The trapezoidal rule approximates the area under the curve by dividing it into trapezoids:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{b - a}{2} [f(a) + f(b)]
\]

### Simpson's Rule
Simpson's rule provides a more accurate approximation by using parabolic segments:
\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{b - a}{6} [f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right) + f(b)]
\]

### Applications in Python
Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy provide functions for numerical integration.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import simpson

# Example data
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([0, 1, 4, 9])  # f(x) = x^2

# Using Simpson's Rule
area = simpson(y, x)
print(f"Area under the curve using Simpson's Rule: {area}") ```

Q.2 Manual Implementation of Numerical Integration

def trapezoidal_rule(f, a, b, n):
    h = (b - a) / n
    integral = 0.5 * (f(a) + f(b))
    for i in range(1, n):
        integral += f(a + i * h)
    integral *= h
    return integral

# Define the function
def f(x):
    return x**2

# Calculate the integral from 0 to 1
result = trapezoidal_rule(f, 0, 1, 1000)
print(f"Trapezoidal Rule Result: {result}")
